      "**Ensemble learning (or \"ensembling\")** is simply the process of combining several models to solve a prediction problem, with the goal of producing a combined model that is more accurate than any individual model. For **classification** problems, the combination is often done by majority vote. For **regression** problems, the combination is often done by taking an average of the predictions.\n",

Instead of building independent models and averaging the predictions, the models are built sequentially on repeatedly modified versions of the data. More information is available in the scikit-learn documentation on Ensemble Methods, namely the sections on [AdaBoost](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost) and [Gradient Tree Boosting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-tree-boosting)."
