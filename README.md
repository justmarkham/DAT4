### Installation and Setup
* Install the [Anaconda distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Python 2.7x.
* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Once you receive an email invitation from [Slack](https://slack.com/), join our "DAT4 team" and add your photo!


### Class 1: Introduction
* Introduction to General Assembly
* Course overview: our philosophy and expectations ([slides](slides/01_course_overview.pdf))
* Data science overview ([slides](slides/01_intro_to_data_science.pdf))
* Tools: check for proper setup of Anaconda, overview of Slack

**Homework:**
* Resolve any installation issues before next class.

**Optional:**
* Review the [code](code/00_python_refresher.py) from Saturday's Python refresher for a recap of some Python basics.
* Read [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf) for a useful look at the different types of data scientists.
* Subscribe to the [Data Community DC newsletter](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/thenewsletter/) or check out their [event calendar](http://www.datacommunitydc.org/calendar) to become acquainted with the local data community.


### Class 2: Python
* Brief overview of Python environments: Python interpreter, IPython interpreter, Spyder
* Python quiz ([solution](code/02_python_quiz_solution.py))
* Working with data in Python
    * Obtain data from a [public data source](public_data.md)
    * [FiveThirtyEight alcohol data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/alcohol-consumption), and [revised data](data/drinks.csv) (continent column added)
    * Reading and writing files in Python ([code](code/02_file_io.py))

**Homework:**
* [Python exercise](code/02_file_io_homework.py)
* Read through the [project page](project.md) in detail.
* Review a few [projects from past Data Science courses](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples) to get a sense of the variety and scope of student projects.
    * Check for proper setup of Git by running `git clone https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT-project-examples.git`

**Optional:**
* If you need more practice with Python, review the "Python Overview" section of [A Crash Course in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182), work through some of [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python), or work through [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) and its exercises.
* For more project inspiration, browse the [student projects](http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2013.html) from Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) at Stanford.

**Resources:**
* [Online Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is useful for visualizing (and debugging) your code.


### Class 3: Getting Data
* Checking your homework
* Any questions about the course project?
* APIs
* Web scraping
* Regular expressions

**Homework:**
* Think about your project question, and start looking for data that will help you to answer your question.
* To prepare for our next class on Git, you'll need to know some command line basics. Please work through GA's excellent [command line tutorial](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/command-line/#/), and then take this brief [quiz](https://gahub.typeform.com/to/J6xirf).

**Optional:**
* If you aren't feeling comfortable with the Python we've done so far, keep practicing using the resources above!
